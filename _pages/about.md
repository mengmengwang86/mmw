A Mechanical Engineering Master of Science from Columbia University, and got Electrical Engineering and Automation bachelor's degree in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I am interested in Robotic, Automation Engineering, Electrical and Electronics Engineering.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Hod Lipson](https://www.hodlipson.com/) of Creative Machines Lab from Columbia University in New York City.
